# Kotlin Reduces Clutter

This repository highlights some of the differences between Java and Kotlin.  It mostly demonstrates how much more concise and readable Kotlin is vs Java.

## How to compile/run tests

The only requirements to use this are Java's JDK 1.8 and internet access. Gradle will handle the rest of the dependencies.

### Windows

From the command prompt/PowerShell

```powershell
gradlew.bat clean test
```

### MacOS/Linux
From the your shell of choice

```bash
./gradlew clean test
```
